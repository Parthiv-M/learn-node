- Explain the order of execution in terms of the event loop for eventloop/poll_timer.js.
The someAsyncOperation() function is called, which forces the event loop into the poll stage
as a file read operation occurs. After that, the callback of the someAsyncOperation() function
is executed as it is the first member of the pending callbacks queue. After that, the setTimeout()
is executed as it is a timer function (with 100ms) and is pushed to the pending callbacks queue after the first callback.

- Will the order of execution change if the delay in the while loop is changed from 10s to 150s? Why or why not?
This will change the execution delay because the while loop runs for a longer time once the callback function of
someAsyncOperation() gets executed. The next callback is waiting in the queue at that time.

- Will the order of execution change if timeout is changed to 0? Why or why not?
Yes this changes the order of execution as the timer executes immediately after the previous line and is
not pushed to the callback queue. Once the timer function is done, the someAsyncOperation() function
executes and then its callback.
