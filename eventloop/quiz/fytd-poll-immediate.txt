- Explain the order of execution in terms of the event loop for eventloop/immediate.js.
- Will the order of execution change if timeout is changed to 0? Why or why not?

This starts the IO process (event loop is in poll stage). As the subsequent callback executes
(after the I/O operation completes), the set timeout inside the callback gets executed (after 5ms). 
setImmediate() is executed right after the I/O operation is complete.
